# Chat History API Changes Summary

## Overview
The Chat History API has been redesigned as a **read-only API** for managing user's continuous chat history. Each user has a single, unified chat history from the beginning to the end. The API now supports **soft delete** for data integrity and recovery purposes.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Simplified API Endpoints (Read-Only)

**Removed endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/chat-history` - Message creation (no longer needed)
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history/date-range` - Date range filtering
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history/sender-type/{senderType}` - Sender type filtering  
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history/{chatId}` - Individual message retrieval

**Current endpoints (4 total):**
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history` - Get complete history with pagination
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history/recent` - Get recent messages for context
- `GET /api/v1/chat-history/count` - Get total message count
- `DELETE /api/v1/chat-history` - Soft delete entire history

### 2. Service Layer Changes

**ChatHistoryService Interface:**
- Removed `addChatMessage()` method (no longer needed)
- Removed date range and sender type filtering methods
- Removed individual message retrieval method
- Kept `getRecentMessages()` method
- Kept `clearUserChatHistory()` method (now performs soft delete)
- Kept `getUserTotalMessageCount()` method

**ChatHistoryServiceImpl:**
- Removed message creation logic
- Focused on read-only operations
- Simplified implementation for continuous conversation retrieval
- Improved error handling for read operations
- **Updated delete operation to use soft delete**

### 3. Repository Layer Changes

**ChatHistoryRepository:**
- Removed date range and sender type query methods
- **Added soft delete support with `deleted` and `deletedAt` fields**
- **Updated queries to filter out soft-deleted records**
- **Added `softDeleteByUserId()` method for soft delete operations**
- Maintained proper `@Modifying` and `@Transactional` annotations
- Kept `deleteByUserId()` for hard delete (cleanup purposes)

### 4. Entity Layer Changes

**ChatHistory Entity:**
- **Added `deleted` field (Boolean) for soft delete flag**
- **Added `deletedAt` field (LocalDateTime) for deletion timestamp**
- **Updated builder to set `deleted = false` by default**

### 5. Mapper Layer Changes

**ChatHistoryMapper:**
- **Updated `toEntity()` to set `deleted = false` for new records**
- **Updated `toResponse()` to filter out deleted records**
- **Added null check for deleted records in mapping**

### 6. Controller Layer Changes

**ChatHistoryController:**
- Removed POST endpoint for message creation
- Simplified to 4 core read/management endpoints
- Improved error handling and logging
- Updated method descriptions for read-only operations
- Increased default page size to 50 for better UX
- **Updated delete endpoint description to reflect soft delete**

## Benefits of the Read-Only Approach

1. **Enhanced Security**: No risk of unauthorized message creation
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Message creation handled by dedicated services
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Focus on retrieval and management only
4. **Better Control**: Centralized message creation logic
5. **Audit Trail**: Clear separation between creation and retrieval
6. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer endpoints and simpler data flow

## Benefits of Soft Delete

1. **Data Recovery**: Deleted records can be recovered if needed
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintains complete history for compliance
3. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental data loss
4. **Analytics**: Allows analysis of deletion patterns
5. **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for data retention

## Message Creation Architecture

Messages are now created through dedicated services:

1. **AI Service**: Handles AI response generation and storage
2. **Chat Service**: Processes user inputs and stores messages
3. **System Services**: Creates system-generated messages
4. **Other Internal Services**: For specialized message types

## Migration Guide

### For Frontend Applications:
1. Remove message creation API calls
2. Use read-only endpoints for conversation display
3. Remove date range and sender type filtering logic
4. Use pagination for large conversation histories
5. Implement recent messages for context retrieval
6. **Note: Delete operations now perform soft delete (data remains recoverable)**

### For Backend Integrations:
1. Remove service method calls for message creation
2. Use the simplified read-only repository methods
3. Update error handling for read operations
4. Remove session-based logic
5. Integrate with dedicated message creation services
6. **Update database schema to include soft delete fields**

## API Usage Examples

### Retrieving Conversation:
```bash
# Get recent messages for context
GET /api/v1/chat-history/recent?limit=10

# Get complete history with pagination
GET /api/v1/chat-history?page=0&size=50

# Check conversation length
GET /api/v1/chat-history/count

# Soft delete conversation history (data remains recoverable)
DELETE /api/v1/chat-history
```

## Data Model
The `ChatHistory` entity now includes soft delete support with `deleted` and `deletedAt` fields.

## Database Schema Changes

**New columns to add:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE chat_history 
ADD COLUMN deleted BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

## Testing
Update existing tests to focus on:
- Message retrieval operations
- Pagination functionality
- Recent messages retrieval
- **Soft delete operations**
- **Filtering of deleted records**
- Read-only access validation

## Integration Notes

This read-only API with soft delete is designed for:
- **Frontend Applications**: Display conversation history
- **AI Services**: Retrieve context for response generation
- **Analytics**: Analyze conversation patterns
- **User Management**: Manage user conversation data
- **Data Recovery**: Maintain data integrity and recovery capabilities
